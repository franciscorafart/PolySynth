How It's Made:

Tech used: WebAudio API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To do the oscillators that make sound I used the Web Audio API. The dynth has 8 note polyphony. I did this by creating 8 oscillators and assigning whatever notes are being playerd to whatever oscillator is free.


Optimizations

In the near future I'll expand the functionality of this project to include knobs hat can control synthesis parameters such as envelope, filters and LFOs.

Lessons Learned:

This project has been my introduction to the WebAudio API.
